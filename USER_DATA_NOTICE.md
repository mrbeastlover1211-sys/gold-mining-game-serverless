# 📢 Important Notice: Game Upgrade & Data Recovery

## 🎮 We've Upgraded Our Game!

We've migrated to a more powerful serverless architecture for better performance and reliability. However, some user data may have been reset during this upgrade.

## 😔 Lost Your Progress?

If you previously:
- ✅ **Purchased land**
- ⛏️ **Owned pickaxes** 
- 💰 **Had gold balance**

And now see the land purchase popup again, **don't worry!** Your purchases are recorded and can be restored.

## 🆘 How to Get Your Data Back:

### **Option 1: Contact Support (Recommended)**
1. **Join our Discord/Telegram** (link in game)
2. **Provide your wallet address**
3. **Tell us what you had:**
   - Land ownership ✅
   - Number of each pickaxe type
   - Approximate gold amount
4. **We'll restore your data within 24 hours**

### **Option 2: Temporary Repurchase**
- **Purchase land again** (0.01 SOL)
- **Contact support afterward** for pickaxe/gold restoration
- **We'll refund the duplicate land purchase**

## 🔒 Your Data is Safe Now

✅ **New database system** - No more data loss  
✅ **Automatic backups** - Your progress is secure  
✅ **Cross-deployment persistence** - Survives all updates  

## 💝 Compensation for the Inconvenience

**All affected users will receive:**
- 🎁 **Bonus gold** (50,000 gold)
